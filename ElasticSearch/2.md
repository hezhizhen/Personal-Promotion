# Preface

the world is swimming in data

existing techonology has focused on how to store and structure warehouses full of data

ES is a distributed, scalable, real-time search and analytics engine, it enables you to search, analyze, and explore your data

ES is not just about full-text search, we explain structured search, analytics, the complexities of dealing with human language, geolocation, and relationships; we also discuss how best to model your data to take advantage of the horizontal scalability of ES, and how to configure and monitor your cluster when moving to production

## Who Should Read This Book

we expect you to have some programming background, which would help to have used a relational database and SQL

## Why We Wrote This Book

the existing reference documentation assumes that you are intimately familiar with information-retrieval concepts, distributed systems, the query DSL, and a host of other topics

we have taken a problem-based approach: this si the problem, how do I solve it, and what are the trade-offs of the alternative solutions?

the existing reference documentation explains how to use features, and the book explains why and when to use various features
