# 2.3 Multifield Search

search for the same or different query strings in one or more fields

## 2.3.1 Multiple Query Strings

the simplest multifield query is the one where we can map search **terms** to specific **fields**

`bool` query takes a **more-matches-is-better** approach

**boost** parameter

* increase the weight of the field (higher than 1)
* inside the `fieldname` field
* default `boost` is 1
* a reasonable range for it lies between 1 and 10, maybe 15 (scores are **normalized**)

## 2.3.2 Single Query String

`bool` query is the mainstay of multiclause queries, especially when you are able to map **different query strings** to **individual fields**

> the problem is, users expect to be able to type all of their search terms into a single field, and expect that the application will figure out how to give them the right results
>
> there is no simple *one-size-fits-all* approach to multiword, multifield queries

to get the best results:

1. know your data
2. know how to use the appropriate tools

when only user input is a **single query stirng**, you will encounter 3 scenarios: 

* best fields: 
    * more together than individually
    * documents should have as many words as possible in the **same field**
* most fields: 
    * a common technique for fine-tuning relevance: index the same data into multiple fields, each with its own analysis chain
    * the more fields that match, the better
* cross fields:
    * for some entities, the identifying information is spread across multiple fields, each of which contians just a part of the whole 
    * want to find as many words as possible in **any** of the listed fields
    * search across multiple fields as if they were one big field

each of these queries requires a different strategy

## 2.3.3 Best Fields

want to find the single *best-matching* field

use the score from the *best-matching* field as the overall score for the query

preference of a single field that contains **both** of the words rather than the **same word** repeated in **diffrent fields**

`dis_max` query (Disjunction Max Query)

* Disjunction: or (conjunction: and)
* return documents that match **any** of these queries
* return the score of the **best matching** query

```elasticsearch
{
    "query": {
        "dis_max": {
            "queries": [
                {"match": {"title": "Brown fox"}},
                {"match": {"body": "Brown fox"}}
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## 2.3.4 Tuning Best Fields Queries

a simple `dis_max` query would choose the **single** best matching field, and ignore otheres

`dis_max` query simply uses the `_score` from the single best-matching clause

**tie_breaker** parameter

* take the `_score` from the other matching clauses into account
* inside `dis_max` and at the same level with `queries`
* multiply the score of each of the other matching clauses by the `tie_breaker` and add it to the `_score`
* a floating-point value between 0 and 1

## 2.3.5 multi_match Query

`multi_match` query runs the **same query** against **multiple fields**

there are more than 3 types of `multi_match` query (`best_fields`, `most_fields`, `cross_fields`, etc)

by default `multi_match` query runs as type `best_fields`

* generate a `match` query for each field
* wrap them in a `dis_max` query

field names can be specified with **wildcards**: anay field matches the wildcard pattern will be included in the search

e.g.: `*_title` will match `book_title`, `chapter_title`, `section_title`

individual fields can be boosted by using the **caret(`^`)** syntax: add `^boost` after the field name (`boost` is a floating-point number)

e.g.: `chapter_title^2`
