### Relax

### A Different Way to Model Your Data

CouchDB combines an intuitive document storage model with a powerful query engine

borrows heavily from web architecture and the the concepts of resources, methods, and representations; add powerful ways to query, map, combine, and filter your data; add fault tolerance, extreme scalability, and incremental replication

### A Better Fit for Common Applications

#### Self-Contained Data

self-contained

#### Syntax and Semantics

real-world document

simply omit something when lacking it

### Building Blocks for Larger Systems

storage system

scaling read requests, write requests, and data

#### CouchDB replication

one of these building blocks

fundamental function: synchronize two or more CouchDB databases

use the same REST API all clients use

a core assumption: things can go wrong

### Local Data Is King

latency is low by default
