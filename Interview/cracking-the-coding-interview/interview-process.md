a screening interview, typically conducted over the phone. it often involves coding and algorithms questions, and the bar can be just as high as it is for in-person interviews. u typically do one or two screening interviewers before being brought on-site.

in an on-site interview round, you usually have 4 to 6 in-person interviews. one of these will be over lunch. the lunch interview is usually not technical, and the interviewer may not even submit feedback. this is a good person to discuss your interests with and to ask about the company culture.

afterwards, the interviewers meet to discuss your performance and/or submit written feedback.

at most companies, your recruiter should respond to you within a week with an update on your status.

if you have waited more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter. no responding indicates nothing about your status
