## 独立写作“四步走”战略

1. 审题，明确立场
> 认真阅读题目，根据主题内容，迅速确定自己的立场(同意，反对，中立)。
>
> 独立写作常考主题：友谊，教育、成功，个人成功，人生观、价值观，家庭、社会，科技、环保，经济、文化，传媒
>
> 主题相关表达、论点、论据(以“个人成功”为例)
> > 常用表达：achieve one's goal, make good efforts, the stepping stone toward success, pave the way for one's personal success, never give up, try one's best to, sense of honor, sense of achievement
> >
> > 备选论点：成功可以带来财富；成功源于自信；竞争激励人们努力拼搏；潜力预示成功；失败是成功的动力；压力可转化为动力；团结协作有助于成功；谦虚使人进步
> >
> > 备选论据：Success often depends upon knowing how long it will take to succeed(孟德斯鸠); There is only one success--to be able to spend your life in your own way(克里斯托弗·莫利);Self-trust is the first secret of success(爱默生)

2. 确定分论点，搭建文章结构框架
> 惯用结构：开头段+主体段+结尾段，其中主体段一般有3个段落，每段围绕一个中心论点展开
>
> 主题句通常为段落首句。First of all, there is no denying that paying a visit to a museum teaches people a great deal about a nation's past. Secondly, visiting museums can also supply people with ample knowledge about the present magnificence of a country. As a matter of fact, in addition to museum visits, there are also other ways to learn about a country.

3. 详细展开论证
> 1. 开头段：提出论题，表明自己的观点立场
>
> Today, a number of college students choose to live off-campus by renting an apartment in a community. They may have their own reasons to justify this choice. However, in spite of the freedom and comfort gained from living outside the university, most students still prefer to live in dormitories. From my standpoint, dormitory life is more meaningful and suitable for students who are pursuing higher education.
>  
> 2. 主体段：以每段主题论点为中心展开详细论证
>
> 需注意：用词地道准确，语言灵活多变；尽可能多变换句式，避免表达单一（如倒装句、疑问句等）；论证方法多样性（例证法：提出论点、列举例证、分析例证、得出结论；因果论证法：提出论点、提出原因、分析条件、得出结果）；多种论据全方位支持，切忌空泛谈论（有效论据包括：名人轶事、历史事件、新闻报道、自己身边的事、科学道理和原理、谚语、成语、名人名言、统计数据、研究成果、调查报告等）
>
> 3. 结尾段：总结前文论述，重申自己的立场
>
> In sum, the mobile and diversified functions of telephones have considerably extended their impact on people's lives in the modern world. Comparatively speaking, the position of TV is no longer as important as it was in the last century. Judging from the reasons listed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the modern telephone has greater influence than TV

4. 检查纠错，及时修改
> 1. 拼写错误
> 2. 语法错误（时态错误、主谓不一致、关联词语重复等）
> 3. 逻辑错误

### Movies: serious or entertaining?

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It's better to watch serious movies to get deeper thoughts than to watch movies that amuse or entertain you.

The world's movies industry has witnessed **unprecedented boom** in recent years. Delighted with **an ample supply of** excellent motion pictures, global audiences are thankful for the combined efforts made by film crews. Among these popular productions, serious movies and entertaining movies are the most influential. Some viewers are **in favor of** the former, saying serious ones evoke deeper thoughts, while other fans support the latter due to their humor. According to my preference, I would express my appreciation for serious movies.

**To begin with**, one of the most essential goals in movie-making is to enrich people's inner world. **To some extent**, serious movies are playing the role of pilots that can guide people psychologically. Books can **provide human with food for thought** and so can serious movies. An outstanding serious movie encourages the audience to make full use of their imaginations and common sense to think logically. Normally, mysteries are hidden in these movies so as to arouse people's curiosity. With a burning desire to find the answer, the viewers try hard to find the answer before the movie concludes. One example is a classic movie entitled ***Murder on the Orient Express***. The plot is so thought-provoking that viewers are turned into detectives themselves. In the movie, a murder is **committed** on the train and a number of passengers are **brought under suspicion**. Motivated to discover the real murderer, viewers are willing to make their own judgment. **Needless to say**, watching such a movie is just like **going on an** unforgettable inner **journey**.

**In addition**, the social and historical background of serious movies provides people with an opportunity to comprehend a vast amount of knowledge. The complicated social reality as well as what is lying deeper inside can also be sensed. ***Gone with the wind***, a most popular movie starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, presents a story during the Civil War. The social realities during that special period in history were vividly shown in the plots. Another example is Tom Hank's master work ***Forrest Gump***. **A series of** historic events are also included inside the movie. The legendary life of Forrest Gump **leaves a profound impression on** all audiences. His frequent encounters of **epoch-making** events, his unique way of thinking and his attitude toward life **along with** his loving heart have made him a forever hero in people's minds.

Even though movies for amusement help people feel relaxed and happy for a while, they might soon be forgotten. By contrast, the influences of serious movies last longer and are more easily treasured as memories. After all, the best art is to be remembered, not to be forgotten. As a matter of fact, seldom do I watch funny movies more than once. After a temporary laugh, nothing meaningful is left, whereas serious movies are cherished as treasures which are appreciated as often as possible. Each viewing will **bring about** fresh thoughts or deeper comprehension.

Therefore, the merits **encompassed** within serious movies **far outweigh** those of funny movies. No matter which feature attracts the largest audience, all producers of serious movies, the directors and the actors, continue their efforts of creating more **memorable** works. **As long as** the film industry advances toward further development, fans of serious movies are always ready to **render** their support.

### Is relating well to others more important than studying hard?

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For future career success, is relating well to other people more important than studying hard at school?

Robinson Crusoe is only a dream hero existing in people's **fancy** world of imagination. As **social beings**, humans **can never do without** the help and support from others. **Isolation** is the strongest enemy in one's career life. It has been widely **acknowledged** that relating well to others **paves the way for** people to achieve professional success. However, that does not mean what has been learned in class is not **worthwhile**. In my opinion, building good relationship with others is as important as studying hard at school.

Above all, knowledge is power, just at **Thomas Jefferson** once expressed. To some extent, the essences contained within all school subjects simply **resemble** the concrete frames of architecture. Without them, the building would soon **collapse**. In order to achieve success in one's future career life, **it is imperative** for students **to** study hard at school. Therefore, there is no excuse for any student to **shun** the most fundamental task of studying. The "**No pains, no gains**" concept should be deeply rooted in the mind. Diligence is the **premise** of a bright future. **In this regard**, we may refer to **Madam Curie**, a Polish physicist and chemist famous for her pioneering research on **radioactivity**. She studied hard at school and earned her higher degrees. The **subsequent** scientific research made her the first person honored with two Nobel Prizes -- in physics and in chemistry. She was the first female professor at the University of Paris. Evidently, these unprecedented achievements **owed much to** Madame Curie's **untiring** efforts at school.

Secondly, the modern world values teamwork, which is a key to career success. Only through **interactions** with partners can one master the art of cooperation. This vividly demonstrates the significance of relating well to others.
