# Tutorial: Intro To React

## Overview

### What is React?

a declarative, efficient and flexible JS library for building user interfaces

has a few different kinds of components

- React component class/type
- a component takes in parameters, called `props`, and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method
- `render` method returns a description of what you want to render, and then React takes the description and renders it to the screen
- `render` returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render
- `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`
