# Getting Started

ES is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine (high speed, large scale, used for full-text search, structured search, analytics)

- Wikipedia      : full-text search with highlighted search snippets, and search-as-you-type and did-you-mean suggestions
- Guardian       : combine visitor logs with social-network data to provide real-time feedback to its editors
- Stack Overflow : combine full-text search with geolocation queries, use more-like-this to find related questions and answers
- GitHub         : query 130 billion lines of code

it has enabled many startups like Datadog and Klout to prototype ideas and to turn them into scalable solutions

there is no point in having data unless you plan to do something with it

No individual part of ES is new or revolutionary. The revolution is the combination of these individually useful parts into a single, coherent, real-time application.

## You Know, for Search...

[Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/): a full-text search-engine library

- Lucene is written in Java, and it is complex
- ES is written in Java, and uses Lucene internally for all of its indexing and searching

ES is more than just a full-text search:

- a distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable
- a distributed search engine with real-time analytics
- capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data

the entire engine is configurable and flexible

### Installing and Running Elasticsearch

Requirement: a recent version of Java

- a node: a running instance of ES
- a cluster: a group of nodes with the same `cluster.name` that are working together to share data and to provide failover and scale (a single node can form a cluster)
- you can change `cluster.name` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file that's loaded when you start a node

Sense: a Kibana app that provides an interactive console for submitting requests to ES directly from your browser

### Talking to Elasticsearch

1. Java API
2. RESTful API with JSON over HTTP

#### Java API

es comes with 2 built-in clients: node client, transport client

#### RESTful API with JSON over HTTP

all other language can communicate with ES over port 9200 using a RESTful API, accessible with your favorite web client

you can talk to ES by using `curl` command

a request to ES consists of the same ports as any HTTP request: `curl -X<VERB> '<PROTOCOL>://<HOST>:<PORT>/<PATH>?<QUERY_STRING>' -d '<BODY>'`

- `<VERB>`         : the appropriate HTTP method or verb, like                                                    : GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE
- `<PROTOCOL>`     : either `http` or `https`
- `<HOST>`         : the hostname of any node in your ES cluster, or `localhost` for a node on your local machine
- `<PORT>`         : the port running the ES HTTP service (default                                                : 9200)
- `<PATH>`         : API endpoint (`_count`                                                                       : return the number of documents in the cluster); path may contain multiple components (like `_cluster/stats` and `_nodes/stats/jvm`)
- `<QUERY_STRING>` : any optional query-string parameters (`?pretty`                                              : pretty-print the JSON response to make it easier to read)
- `<BODY>`         : a JSON-encoded request body (if the request needs one)

an example (count the number of documents in the cluster):

```bash
curl -XGET `http://localhost:9200/_count?pretty` -d '
{
"query": {
    "match_all": {}
}
}
'
```

ES returns an HTTP status code like `200 OK` and a JOSN-encoded reponse body

to see the HTTP headers, use `curl` with `-i` switch: `curl -i -XGET 'localhost:9200/'`

### Document Oriented

objects in an application are seldom just a simple list of keys and values; they are complex data structures that may contain dates, geolocations, other objects, or arrays of values

es is document oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents; it also indexes the contents of each document, in order to make them searchable

in ES: index, search, sort, filter documents (not rows of columnar data)

ES uses `JSON` as the serialization format for documents (JSON serialization has become the standdar format used by the NoSQL movement; simple, concise, easy to read)

look for modules that handle JSON serialization or marshalling

### Finding Your Feet

basic concepts: indexing, search, aggregations

### Indexing Employee Documents

the first order: store data

indexing: the act of storing data in ES

before we can index a document, we need to decide where to store it

an ES cluster can contain multiple `indices`, which in turn contain multiple `types`. These `types` hold multiple `documents`, and each `document` has multiple `fields`

**index**

- as a noun      : an index is like a database in a traditional relational database; it is the place to store related documents
- as a verb      : to index a document is to store a document in an index so that it can be retrieved and queried (it is much like `INSERT` in SQL, but the new document would replace the old one if exists)
- inverted index : ES use a structure called `an inverted index` for exactly the same purpose (relational databses add an index like B-tree index to specific columns)

every **field** in a document is indexed (has an inverted index) and is searchable (a field without an inverted index is not searchable)

for the employee directory:

- index a document per employee, which contains all the details of a single employee
- each document wil be of type `employee`
- the type will live in the `megacorp` index
- the index will reside within the es cluster

```bash
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/1?pretty' -d '{
"first_name"     : "John",
"last_name"      : "Smith",
"age"            : 25,
"about"          : "I love to go rock climbing",
"interests"      : ["sports", "music"]
}'
```

- `megacorp` : the index name
- `employee` : the type name
- `1`        : the ID of the particular employee

### Retrieving a Document

simply execute an HTTP `GET` request and specify the `address` of the document (the index, type, ID)

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/1?pretty'
```

the response contains some metadata about the document, and John's original JSON document as the `_source` field

- PUT    : store documents; replace an existing document with a new one
- GET    : retrieve documents
- DELETE : delete documents
- HEAD   : check whether documents exist

### Search Lite

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search'
```

search for all employees (the response includes all the doucments in the `hits` array; by default a search will return the top 10 results)

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search?q=last_name;Smith'
```

search for employees who has "Smith" in their last name (use a lightweight search method; the method is referred to as a query-string search)

### Search with Query DSL

ES provides a rich, flexible, query language called `query DSL` (domain specific language), which uses a JSON request body

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search' -d '
{
"query": {
"match": {
"last_name": "Smith"
}
}
}
'
```

we do not use `query-string` parameters, but instead a `request body`, which is built with JSON and uses a `match` query

### More-Complicated Searches

add a filter

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search' -d '
{
"query": {
"bool": {
"must": {
"match": {
    "last_name": "smith"
}
},
"filter": {
"range": {
"age": {
"gt": 30
}
}
}
}
}
}
'
```

- `match`: literally
- `range` filter: find all ages older than 30 (`gt` stands for greater than)

### Full-Text Search

e.g.: search `about`

es sorts matching results by their relevance score (how well each document matches the query)

`_score`

the concept of **relevance**

### Phrase Search

want to match exact sequences of words or phrases

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search' -d '
{
"query": {
"match_phrase": {
"about": "rock climbing"
}
}
}
'
```

### Highlighting Our Searches

add a `highlight` parameter

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search' -d '
{
"query": {
"match_phrase": {
"about": "rock climbing"
}
},
"highlight":{
"fields":{
"about":{}
}
}
}
'
```

### Analytics

allow managers to run analytics over the employee directory

aggregations: es functionality, allow you to generate sophisticated analytics over your data (similar to `GROUP BY` in SQL)

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/megacorp/employee/_search' -d '
{
"aggs": {
"all_interests": {
"terms": {
    "field": "interests"
}
}
}
}
'
```

find the most popular interests enjoyed by the employees

```
GET ...
{
"query":{
"match":{
"last_name":"smith"
}
},
"aggs":{
"all_interests":{
"terms":{
"field":"interests"
}
}
}
}
```

find the popular interests of people called Smith

the `all_interests` aggregations

aggregations allow hierachical rollups

```
GET ...
{
"aggs": {
"all_interests":{
"terms":{
"field": "interests"
},
"aggs":{
"avg_age":{
"avg":{
"field":"age"
}
}
}
}
}
}
```

find the average age of employees who share a particular interest

### Tutorial Conclusion

many features - such as suggestions, geolocation, percolation, fuzzy and partial matching - were omitted to keep the tutorial short

### Distributed Nature

es is distributed by nature, and it is designed to hide the complexity that comes with being distributed

distributed concepts: distributed systems, sharding, cluster discovery, etc

some of the operations happening automatically under the hood:

- partition your documents into different containers or shards, which can be stored on a single node or multiple nodes
- balance these shards across the nodes in your cluster to spread the indexing and search load
- duplicate each shard to provide redundant copies of your data, to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure
- route requests from any node in the cluster to the nodes that hold the data you are interested in
- seamlessly integrate new nodes as your cluster grows or redistribute shards to recover from node loss

### Next Steps

the best way to learn ES is by jumping in: just start indexing and searching

the more you can tell es about the domain-specific elements of your application, the more you can fine-tune the output
