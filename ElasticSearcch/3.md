# Getting Started

ES is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine (high speed, large scale, used for full-text search, structured search, analytics)

- Wikipedia      : full-text search with highlighted search snippets, and search-as-you-type and did-you-mean suggestions
- Guardian       : combine visitor logs with social-network data to provide real-time feedback to its editors
- Stack Overflow : combine full-text search with geolocation queries, use more-like-this to find related questions and answers
- GitHub         : query 130 billion lines of code

it has enabled many startups like Datadog and Klout to prototype ideas and to turn them into scalable solutions

there is no point in having data unless you plan to do something with it

No individual part of ES is new or revolutionary. The revolution is the combination of these individually useful parts into a single, coherent, real-time application.

## You Know, for Search...

[Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/): a full-text search-engine library

- Lucene is written in Java, and it is complex
- ES is written in Java, and uses Lucene internally for all of its indexing and searching

ES is more than just a full-text search:

- a distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable
- a distributed search engine with real-time analytics
- capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data

the entire engine is configurable and flexible

### Installing and Running Elasticsearch

Requirement: a recent version of Java

- a node: a running instance of ES
- a cluster: a group of nodes with the same `cluster.name` that are working together to share data and to provide failover and scale (a single node can form a cluster)
- you can change `cluster.name` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file that's loaded when you start a node

Sense: a Kibana app that provides an interactive console for submitting requests to ES directly from your browser
